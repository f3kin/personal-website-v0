          Hello! I'm John, a passionate web developer and designer with over 5 years of experience creating modern,
          responsive websites and applications. I specialize in React, Next.js, and other cutting-edge technologies that
          help businesses and individuals establish a strong online presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in web development began during my computer science studies, where I discovered my passion for
          creating beautiful, functional user interfaces. Since then, I've worked with startups, agencies, and
          established companies to deliver high-quality digital products that users love.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, experimenting with photography, or
          contributing to open-source projects. I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest
          trends and technologies in the ever-evolving web development landscape.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you have a project in mind or just want to chat,
          feel free to reach out!
