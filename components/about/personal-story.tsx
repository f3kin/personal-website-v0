          Hey, I'm Finlay! I moved from Sydney to Melbourne in 2022 to study Mechatronics Engineering. I quickly realised 
          I wasn't cut out for working 9-5, so I cut my degree short and entered the startup ecosystem.

        <p>
          I've worked in a few startups, and founded two of my own. I am currently riding the AI wave, working on an AI 
          automation agency and my second startup. I'm always open to new conversations, feel free to reach out!
