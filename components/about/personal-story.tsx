          Hello! I'm Finlay, a curious soul with a passion for exploration, creativity, and meaningful connections. Born
          and raised in a small coastal town, I developed an early appreciation for nature's wonders and the simple joys
          of life.

        <p>
          My journey has taken me through various cities, countries, and experiences that have shaped who I am today. I
          studied literature and philosophy in college, which sparked my love for storytelling and deep conversations
          about life's big questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduation, I spent several years working in different fields—from education to hospitality to
          technology—always seeking to learn and grow. Along the way, I discovered my passion for photography, cooking,
          and music, which have become important creative outlets in my life.
        </p>

          In 2020, I made a significant life change by moving to a new city where I knew no one. This leap of faith
          taught me resilience, adaptability, and the joy of building a life from scratch. It's been one of the most
          challenging yet rewarding chapters of my story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I'm focused on living mindfully, nurturing meaningful relationships, and continuing to explore this
          beautiful world we live in. This website is my digital garden—a space to share my experiences, thoughts, and
          the lessons I'm learning along the way.
